# PrisonLifeGui
A basic prison life GUI.

- Get guns and melee weapons
- Change character properties
- Change between teams
- ESP
- Teleports
- Kill any player

More coming soon. 
Tested on Synapse X and KRNL.

## Updates
- Changed the UI library since old one is not gonna get updates anymore (probably). You can still find it in old.lua

## Execute the GUI
Get all the updates by using this code.
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CrowsMaster/PrisonLifeGui/main/master.lua"))()
```
